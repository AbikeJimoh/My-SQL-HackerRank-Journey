# My-SQL-HackerRank-Journey
## Introduction
Welcome to my repository of SQL solutions! This collection represents my journey through various SQL challenges on HackerRank. The purpose of this repository is to document my learning progress, share my approaches to these SQL problems, and assist others who are learning or improving their SQL skills.

## Contents
This repository is organized into several folders, each representing a different SQL topic:

Basic Select: Solutions that demonstrate fundamental SELECT statements in SQL.
Advanced Select: More complex SELECT queries, showcasing the use of functions, conditional statements, and other advanced techniques.
Aggregation: Solutions that involve SQL aggregate functions like COUNT, AVG, SUM, and more, used to generate summary data from sets of rows.
Basic Join: Examples of how to use JOIN operations to combine rows from two or more tables based on related columns.
Each folder contains SQL files with the solutions and a brief description of each problem being solved.

## Installation and Usage
No installation is required. You can view the SQL files directly on GitHub or clone the repository to your local machine for a closer look:

git clone https://github.com/AbikeJimoh/HackerRank-SQL-Solutions.git
